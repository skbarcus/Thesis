This thesis was made possible by the many extraordinary people in my life. Words are insufficient to express my gratitude to all of you.

Thank you to my advisor Todd Averett for his constant support and guidance. I am extremely grateful for the freedom and independence you allowed me in my work. The free reign you gave me at JLab let me experience every part of planning, building, running, and analyzing experiments.

I would also like to thank my JLab advisor Douglas Higinbotham. You had no obligation to give me your time, yet you chose to become a mentor and gave me countless hours of advice and guidance. Your passion and enthusiasm for physics was a steady reminder of why we do our research. You kept advocating for my part of the Tritium Experiments, and though it never happened you provided me with the data used in this thesis making thesis number three the final one.

My thanks to the many others at JLab who supported me in my graduate work. I am grateful to my other JLab mentors Bogdan Wojtsekhowski and Bob Michaels for patiently lending me their time and expertise as I learned the work of a physics researcher. Thanks to all of the fellow graduate students I worked with over the years, particularly those in the Tritium Collaboration. Special thanks to Dien Nguyen for pioneering this dataset and helping me with the initial analysis. Thanks also to the many postdocs I have worked with including Carlos                                                                      Ayerbe-Gayoso, Huan Yao, Evan McClellan, and Florian Hauenstein for their willingness to teach me.

Of course, none of this would be possible without the love and support of my family. Thank you to my parents Kevin and Vicki Barcus for giving me every possible advantage in life. Thank you for encouraging me to follow my own path in life and for cheering me on at every turn. You raised me to be the person I am happy to be today. I will always be proud to return your unconditional love. Thanks to my brother, Jeff Barcus, who has always been a kindred spirit and someone I can be completely open with. I will always cherish your companionship.

I must also thank the many friends I made a W $\&$ M. Without their help passing my classes and completing this program would have been infinitely more difficult. To Perry Nerem
