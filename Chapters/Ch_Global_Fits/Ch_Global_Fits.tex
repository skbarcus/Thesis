This chapter will discuss the world data for elastic $^3$H and $^3$He cross sections. This data will then be fit using a sum of Gaussians (SOG) technique. These new global fits will incorporate new data sets added to the world data since the last global fits were performed. This will include new high Q$^2$ data from JLab for both $^3$H and $^3$He as well as the cross section extracted in this thesis. The SOG fitting technique allows the electric and magnetic form factors to be easily extracted as well as for charge radii to be calculated. These new results will then be compared to past fits as well as some theory predictions.

\section{World Data}
\label{sec:world_data}

The world data for elastic $^3$H and $^3$He cross sections spans across numerous decades, laboratories, and continents. Due to the expansiveness of the data set there are many inconsistent methodologies employed in the different datasets collected. Efforts were taken to make these comparisons as consistent as possible, however it was often impossible with the exiting literature to be certain which techniques were used. There are also differences in modifications such as radiative correction calculations and Dirac wave Born approximations (DWBA) that would be extremely time consuming to force all data sets into complete methodological agreement. As such some of the datasets fit together are not guaranteed to be completely apples-to-apples comparisons, however the methodological differences result in very minor changes to the final cross sections, and thus do not significantly impact the efficacy of the new global fits.
