\chapter{Global Fits} % Main chapter title
\label{ch:global_fits} % For referencing the chapter elsewhere, use 

This chapter will discuss the world data for elastic $^3$H and $^3$He cross sections. This data will then be fit using a sum of Gaussians (SOG) technique. These new global fits will incorporate new data sets added to the world data since the last global fits were performed. This will include new high Q$^2$ data from JLab for both $^3$H and $^3$He as well as the cross section extracted in this thesis. The SOG fitting technique allows the electric and magnetic form factors to be easily extracted as well as for charge radii to be calculated. These new results will then be compared to past fits as well as some theory predictions.

\section{World Data}
\label{sec:world_data}

The world data for elastic $^3$H and $^3$He cross sections spans across numerous decades, laboratories, and continents. Due to the expansiveness of the data set there are many inconsistent methodologies employed in the different datasets collected. Efforts were taken to make these comparisons as consistent as possible, however it was often impossible with the exiting literature to be certain which techniques were used. There are also differences in modifications such as radiative correction calculations and Dirac wave Born approximations (DWBA) that would be extremely time consuming to force all data sets into complete methodological agreement. As such some of the datasets fit together are not guaranteed to be completely apples-to-apples comparisons, however the methodological differences result in very minor changes to the final cross sections, and thus do not significantly impact the efficacy of the new global fits.

Table ~\ref{tab:world_data_3h} lists the literature comprising the current world data of $^3$H elastic cross sections and Table ~\ref{tab:world_data_3he} contains the $^3$He world data compiled for this analysis. The table is organized chronologically from oldest dataset to most recent. The table lists the title of each publication, the first author listed on each publication, the journal the publication appeared in, and the location of the measurement with the year it was published. The table also contains physics data on each experiment. This physics data includes the target type, the rough Q$^2$ range covered by the experiment, whether the paper lists cross sections explicitly, whether the paper lists form factors explicitly, if the paper applied a phase shift correction to account for the plane wave approximation, and finally a brief note on the radiative corrections each paper used. Whenever a table entry wasn't listed or was unclear a ? was used.

The datasets used in the SOG global fits in this thesis are marked with a * after the listed dates. Not all of the datasets were able to be used in this analysis for various reasons. The most common reason a data set is not used is simply that the publication did not list its data points in the publication so they could not be added to the fit. Another common reason was publications listing only the extracted form factors and not cross sections. This is not an issue when the publication also lists the beam energy and scattering angle for each data point (or Q$^2$ and one of either the energy or angle) as the cross section can be computed for using these values. However, numerous publications list only the form factors without energies or angles making it impossible to calculate a cross section for each data point to be used in the global fit. Some publications like Arnold 1978 used different ways to parameterize form factors, and whenever possible these methods were converted to cross sections.

\section{Sum of Gaussians Parameterization}
\label{sec:sog}

The sum of Gaussians (SOG) parameterization is a powerful method for fitting nuclear cross section data developed by Ingo Sick in the early 1970s \cite{Article:SOG}. It attempts to fit elastically scattered electron cross sections by representing the electric (sometimes referred to as the charge F$_{ch}$) and magnetic (F$_{m}$) form factors as the sum of numerous Gaussians. The technique attempts to remain model independent while taking several physical requirements for the form factors and nuclear wave functions in to account. However, a model dependence of sorts does enter the fits in the form of the radii at which the various Gaussians are situated. SOG fits make the extraction of the charge and magnetic form factors easy to extract, and along with them the charge density and charge radii of the target.

Sick outlines the rules for removing a global model dependence when fitting cross section data as follows,

\begin{quote}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Accept some clearly specified limitation to generality (accept some model dependence), since data with infinite q$_{max}$ are not available (wavelengths smaller than $\lambda = \frac{2\pi}{q_{max}}$ are not determined by experiment).
		\item Choose a restriction to generality which can be justified by physical arguments.
		\item Write the density in a manner which decouples densities at different radii as much as possible.\cite{Article:SOG}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{quote} 

One of the first physical restrictions that can be applied by the SOG parameterization is on the nuclear charge densities. No structures in the nuclear charge densities are allowed to be larger than the RMS radii of the proton \cite{Article:SOG}. As this thesis is often using \cite{Article:Amroun} as a point of comparison this work employs the same minimum size allowed for structure used by Amroun \textit{et al.} of 0.8 fm, or slightly less than the proton's radius. 

A second restriction comes from the fact that the amplitudes of the high frequency components of the nuclear wave functions have limits placed on them. This can be seen by noting that the Schr{\"o}dinger equation strongly couples the second derivative of the radial wave functions to the proton's separation energy. This implies that the proton will become less bound for larger amplitudes and shorter wavelengths of the radial wave functions. This is yet another reason to forbid certain structures in the nuclear charge density smaller than a certain width \cite{Article:SOG}.
