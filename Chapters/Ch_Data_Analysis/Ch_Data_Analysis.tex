\section{Overview}
\label{sec:analysis_overview}

This chapter will explore the various analyses used to extract a $^3$He elastic cross section. This discussion will include all measurements required to extract a differential cross section, the corrections for efficiency losses for these values, the physics cuts applied to the data, and an estimate of the uncertainties. Also discussed will be the Monte Carlo software used to create an artificial elastic electron spectrum as well as the software used to calculate radiative corrections to this data.

\section{Experimental Cross Section}
\label{sec:exp_xs}

The theoretical origins of a differential cross section were explored in ~\ref{sec:xs}. However, this derivation is not particularly intuitive for extracting an actual experimental cross section. In practice extracting a cross section is essentially an exercise in electron counting. Let us now write the cross section as an experimentalist understands it as in Equation ~\ref{eq:exp_xs}. Each of these variables will be examined in detail later in this chapter.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:exp_xs}
	\left(\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}\right)_{exp} = \frac{ps*N_e}{N_{in}*\rho *LT* \epsilon_{det}} \frac{1}{\Delta\Omega\Delta P \Delta Z}
\end{equation}

Here $ps$ represents the prescale value of the given trigger being examined. $N_e$ is the number of electrons detected by the experiment that survive physics cuts, like particle identification, and acceptance cuts. $N_{in}$ is the number of electrons incident on the target, and can be calculated from the cumulative beam charge. $\rho$ is the target's density. $LT$ is the livetime correction which accounts for events missed due to electronic dead-time in the DAQ. $\epsilon_{det}$ represents the product of all of the detector efficiencies such as the GC, VDC single track, EM calorimeter, and trigger efficiencies. $\Delta\Omega$ represent the solid angle fraction covered by the spectrometer after acceptance cuts. $\Delta P$ is the momentum acceptance seen by the spectrometer after acceptance cuts. Finally $\Delta Z$ represents the length of the target seen by the spectrometer.

\subsection{Beam Charge}
\label{ssec:charge}

As the the cross section extraction is essentially an exercise in electron counting let us begin by finding the charge of the electron beam during any given experimental run. This process begins with the U and D BCMs measuring the beam current prior to the beam striking the target. These BCMs require are calibrated according to Equation ~\ref{eq:bcms}, and the constants can be found in Table ~\ref{tab:bcm_constants}. The BCM calibration for experiment E08-014 can be read about more in ~\cite{bcm_calibration} where these equations are found. The final constants in the table were updated after the analysis in ~\cite{bcm_calibration}, and were provided via private communication with Dien Nguyen.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:bcms}
	\langle I_{beam} \rangle = \frac{\frac{scalar}{time}-K'_{offset}}{C_{V-to-F}}
\end{equation}

\begin{table}[!h]

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\bf{BCM Calibration Constants for E08-014}}
\label{tab:bcm_constants}
\end{table}

The average current, $\langle I_{beam} \rangle$, is thus a product of the number of counts in the $scaler$ measuring beam current in a certain period of $time$ tracked by a clock scaler, and then modified by the two calibration constants $K'_{offset}$ and $C_{V-to-F}$. Now that we have a current we can calculate the charge, $Q$, of the beam during a run by Equation ~\ref{eq:charge}. We can then divide the charge by the elementary charge of the electron, $e$, to find the total number of electrons incident on our target, $N_{in}$, as in Equation ~\ref{eq:electrons}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:charge}
	Q = \langle I_{beam} \rangle *time
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:electrons}
	N_{in} = \frac{Q}{e}
\end{equation}

Figure ~\ref{fig:bcms_4074} shows the current as measured by the $U_1$ and $D_1$ BCMs for experimental run 4074. During E08-014 the target beam current 120 $\mu$A. When the beam `trips' turning off and when the beam is being brought online it tends to be somewhat unstable. These events can be seen in the trailing edges and leading edges of the gaps in the BCM current measurement. Due to the beam's instability at these times measurements taken during them are discarded by placing cuts on the current spectrum represented by the red lines in ~\ref{fig:bcms_4074}. These lines are placed two scaler readouts, about 4 seconds per readout, after the BCMs register 90$\%$ or greater of the 120 $\mu$A operating current. This analysis was performed for each run of KIN 3.2 and the results are shown in Table ~\ref{tab:charges}.

\subsection{Dead-time Correction}
\label{ssec:dead-time}

Now we have measured how many electrons total are incident on our target. However, we have not yet accounted for the electronic dead-time discussed in Section ~\ref{sec:daq} and Equation ~\ref{eq:lt}. While the electronics discard some valid trigger events because the system is busy processing the previous event there are still scalers that record every trigger created regardless of if it is recorded by the main DAQ. This means that the dead-time of the system can be calculated by taking the ratio of the total triggers recorded by the DAQ electronics to the total hardware triggers recorded by the scalers. Table ~\ref{tab:dead-time} contains the dead-time for each run as well as the weighted average of dead-times for the cumulative runs. The weighted average live-time, one minus dead-time, of 95.27$\%$ is then applied as a correction of $\frac{1}{0.9527}$ to the total number of elastic electrons detected.

\end{table}

\subsection{Trigger Efficiency}
\label{ssec:trigger_eff}

The main trigger, $T_3$, for E08-014 was a coincidence of $S_1$, $S_{2m}$, and the $GC$ detectors. However, this trigger is not perfectly efficient. To measure $T_3$'s efficiency we use trigger $T_4$ which is the coincidence of one of either $S_1$ or $S_{2m}$ and the $GC$. The efficiency of $T_3$ can then be calculated by Equation ~\ref{eq:t3_eff} with $PS_{3,4}$ being the prescale value of $T_3$ or $T_4$ and $n_{T_{3,4}}$ being the number of triggers of either $T_3$ or $T_4$. Figure ~\ref{fig:t3_eff} shows the $T_3$ efficiencies for each of the runs, and Table ~\ref{tab:t3_eff} lists these efficiencies along with the weighted average of the runs. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:t3_eff}
	T_{3_{eff}} = \frac{PS_{T_3}*n_{T_3}}{PS_{T_3}*n_{T_3}+PS_{T_4}*n_{T_4}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{VDC Single Track Efficiency}
\label{ssec:vdc_eff}

In general the VDCs are very efficient, but it is possible for particles to make several tracks in the VDCs. This can cause issues with track reconstruction. For the analysis of E08-014 only events making a single track in the VDCs that also passed PID cuts were analyzed. This single track efficiency can be calculated with equation ~\ref{eq:vdc_eff}. Where $N_{track=1}$ is the number of events making only a single track and $N_{0 \leq track \leq 4}$ are the number of events producing between one and four tracks. For the LHRS during experiment E08-014 $\epsilon_{VDC}$ was found to be , and Table ~\ref{tab:vdc_eff} gives the breakdown for both detectors by number of tracks seen. For more detailed information on this calibration see ~\cite{Thesis:Ye} where these values were calculated. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:vdc_eff}
	\epsilon_{VDC} = \frac{N_{track=1}}{N_{0 \leq track \leq 4}}
\end{equation}

\end{table}

\subsection{Particle Identification}
\label{ssec:pid}

When a trigger is seen it is important to be able to identify what particle caused the trigger. For this analysis we are only interested in electrons, but pions occasionally cause triggers as well. Figure ~\ref{fig:pid_pr_ye} shows a plot of the two pion rejector calorimeters used for PID in E08-014. As discussed in Section ~\ref{ssec:em_cal} electrons will leave large signals in the PRs, and pions much smaller signals. Using this property of the PRs we can show the area almost certain to be electrons shaded blue, and the area we expect to be pions is shaded red. Note that the blue (red) region is not all of the electrons (pions), but triggers in the blue (red) region are almost certainly electrons (pions). The other low energy events not identified as pions are generally delta, or knock-on, electrons which are created when particles strike the metals of the detector frame and spectrometer apertures etc. We can see for this one particular run, that was not part of this analysis, that there is a non-zero pion contamination in this data. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{PID_PR_Ye.png}
\end{center}
\caption{
{\bf{PID with the Pion Rejectors.}} Image from ~\cite{Thesis:Ye}}.
\label{fig:pid_pr_ye}
\end{figure}

Alternatively, we can look at the same data in the GC to identify the particles as in Figure ~\ref{fig:pid_gc_ye}. We discussed how the gas in the GC is chosen for electrons to emit Cherenkov radiation in Section ~\ref{ssec:gc}. Due to this gas choice pions rarely will cause Cherenkov radiation. We can see this difference in ~\ref{fig:pid_gc_ye} by identifying the bulk of the signal, blue, as electrons, and the lowest signals, red, as pions. Again, the blue (red) region is not all of the electrons (pions), but triggers in the blue (red) region are almost certainly electrons (pions). In this data we see the non-zero pion contamination again. Fortunately, as with the PR plots, the pions and electrons are easy to distinguish from one another.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.1\linewidth]{PID_GC_Ye.png}
\end{center}
\caption{
{\bf{PID with the Gas Cherenkov.}} Image from ~\cite{Thesis:Ye}}.
\label{fig:pid_gc_ye}
\end{figure}

Now let us examine the combined six experimental runs used in this analysis using the PRs and GC. Figure ~\ref{fig:pid_pr} shows the PRs for our data with reasonable physics cuts applied to the data. We see the same `cloud' of electrons in the higher PR ADC channels indicating that electron energy is being well measured by the PRs. The red box in this clod shows a similar region to before where we are almost certain to have `good' electrons. However, when we search for the pion cloud in the lower energy channels, represented by the small red box in the lower left, we see very few pions at all. This is a result of KIN 3.2 producing few pions that can be measured by the detectors so our pion contamination is extremely low. The small number of pions can be eliminated by placing a diagonal cut on the data represented by the green line.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.\linewidth]{PID_PR.png}
\end{center}
\caption{
{\bf{PID with the Pion Rejectors.}} }.
\label{fig:pid_pr}
\end{figure}

We can also examine the GC, Figure ~\ref{fig:pid_gc}, as we did previously. Once again we have applied reasonable physics cuts to the data. We see a large bulk signal at its strongest between channels 300 and 500, shown between two red lines, as expected. This shows that we are getting good detecting electrons well with the GC. Looking in the lower ADC channels for pions we again see that there seem to be very few in our data. In fact, below ADC channel 80 we see only 15 events showing that there are very few pions in our sample. As a result when making the final cuts to the data only the diagonal cut on the PRs was used to eliminate possible pions and more likely junk electrons which are mostly likely delta electrons.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.\linewidth]{PID_GC.png}
\end{center}
\caption{
{\bf{PID with the Gas Cherenkov.}} }.
\label{fig:pid_gc}
\end{figure}

Now that we have demonstrated that very few pions are contaminating our electron sample we must still account for inefficiencies in the GC. During E08-014 one of the ten PMTs in the LHRS GC was slightly inefficient and this PMT happens to fall near the kinematics of this data. To study the GC efficiency we can use $T_3$ the main trigger which was a coincidence of $S_1$, $S_{2m}$, and the $GC$ detectors as well as $T_7$ which is a coincidence of $S_1$ and $S_{2m}$. Thus the ratio of $T_3$ + $T_7$ to $T_7$ will yield the GC efficiency for these E08-014 runs as shown by Equation ~\ref{eq:gc_eff}. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:gc_eff}
	\epsilon_{GC} = \frac{T_3+T_7}{T_7}
\end{equation}

Before we find the GC efficiency let us first place some reasonable kinematic and acceptance cuts on the combined data of our six experimental runs (see ~\ref{ssec:cuts} for details on the cut values). Figure ~\ref{fig:gc_eff} shows a plot of $T_7$ on the left and $T_3$ + $T_7$ on the right with physics cuts. These cuts are fairly strict and include a cut on $X_{Bj}$ so there are few events. Still the events form the elastic band shape we would expect. Taking the ratio we find that $\epsilon_{GC} = 196/203 = 0.966$. This is still quite efficient accounting for the slightly inefficient PMT. Knowing the GC inefficiency allows us to scale the final cross section value by 203/196 to correct for this inefficiency.

\caption{
{\bf{GC Efficiency.}} The left plot is $T_7$ with physics cuts and the right is $T_3$ + $T_7$ with physics cuts.}
\label{fig:gc_eff}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Target Boiling}
\label{ssec:boiling}

As the electron beam passes through the gaseous $^3$He target it causes the target to heat considerably. In the ideal case the target would heat uniformly, but studies of the target boiling effect during E08-014 indicate that the target boiled preferentially based on the target's long axis, $Z_{react}$. Figure ~\ref{fig:boiling_effect} shows events detected along $Z_{react}$ for various beam currents. The two peaks at are the endcaps of the target. It is clear from this plot that the density of the gas across the cell is not constant otherwise the event rate would be approximately constant.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.\linewidth]{Boiling_Effect.png}
\end{center}
\caption[\bf{$^3$He Boiling Effect.}]{
{\bf{$^3$He Boiling Effect.}} Image from ~\cite{Thesis:Ye}.}
\label{fig:boiling_effect}
\end{figure}

Due to this unusual density profile our Monte Carlo results need to account for this boiling effect otherwise we will have a less accurate simulation of the elastic events. Figure ~\ref{fig:density_profile} shows the step function, blue line, chosen to approximate the target's measured boiling effect which is shown by the red dots. This was implemented by running the MC with one density and then running the MC again with a second density. These MC data runs were then joined by cutting on each dataset where the step in the density profile is located. The cross section results did not vary significantly when this split density profile was implemented. For a detailed discussion of the target boiling studies see ~\cite{Thesis:Ye} Section 5.4.1 and Appendix D.

\label{fig:density_profile}
\end{figure}

\subsection{$^3$He Elastic Cross Section Monte Carlo}
\label{ssec:simc}

To extract the final $^3$He elastic cross section value for this analysis a physics simulation Monte Carlo program called SIMC was used. This program is primarily used by JLab's halls A and C to simulate electron scattering experiments. SIMC contains the geometry of the Hall A spectrometers including their various apertures and the materials that comprise them. SIMC uses an event generator to create the physics events resulting from electrons scattering from a given target. These events are transported through the spectrometer based on an optics matrix which allows for the transformation of detector coordinates to target coordinates. 

SIMC requires numerous inputs before generating the initial events. The program must be given ranges in momentum, in-plane angle ($\phi$), out-of-plane angle ($\theta$), beam energy, and spectrometer angle. These acceptances are chosen to match the conditions of the real world Hall A experimental setup. SIMC then randomly and uniformly creates particles in the detector in the provided acceptance ranges. SIMC then calculates the energy of each electron produced and weights each event by the cross section and finally applies radiative corrections (see ~\ref{ssec:rc}) to that event. 

SIMC then transforms these events back through the spectrometer to their reaction vertex in the target. Along the way it applies energy losses due to multiple scattering as well as ionization and Bremsstrahlung. The spectrometer magnets are modelled using the COSY INFINITY program ~\cite{cosy}. This program contains the various transformation matrices required to transport particles between the various coordinate systems and through the spectrometer. While being transported through the spectrometer SIMC checks to be sure that all recorded electrons do not strike the walls of the spectrometer or the non-sensitive elements of the detectors in the stack, and that the electrons pass through all apertures in the spectrometer. SIMC also applies a smearing function to the electrons' VDC positions to match the real world VDCs ~\cite{Thesis:Wang}. 

\subsection{Radiative Corrections}
\label{ssec:rc}

In Chapter ~\ref{ch:elastic} we discussed the lowest order (Born term) Feynman diagram for elastic electron scattering. While this is a good first approximation other diagrams contribute significantly to the cross section and must be accounted for as well. These diagrams can be categorized as external or internal radiative corrections. External corrections are characterized by interactions with other particles that are not the primary scattering source for the electron. These corrections come in the form of Bremsstrahlung radiation and ionization. Bremsstrahlung radiation is the radiation released as photons when electrons are slowed down by the Coulomb fields of particles in the materials the electron is passing through. 

Internal corrections are characterized by the electron interacting with the primary scattering source via the exchange of real or virtual photons. Figure ~\ref{fig:rc} shows the additional first order diagrams for internal corrections along with the Born term diagram. Once more we can break these diagrams in to the two categories of elastic and inelastic corrections. The elastic corrections exchange only virtual photons shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:rc} b), c), and d). The inelastic corrections emit real photons as seen in e) ~\cite{Thesis:Wang}.

\end{center}
\caption[\bf{Born and Lowest Order Radiative Correction Diagrams}]{
{\bf{Born and Lowest Order Radiative Correction Diagrams.}} Image from ~\cite{Thesis:Wang}.}
\label{fig:rc}
\end{figure}

The radiative corrections for E08-014 were calculated by the program XEMC. For a detailed discussion of the radiative corrections applied by XEMC see ~\cite{Article:RC} and ~\cite{Article:RC2}. This program is derived from a previous program called RadCor which is detailed in ~\cite{Thesis:Yao} and ~\cite{Thesis:Slifer}. XEMC uses the built in cross section model to calculate the Born cross section, without radiative corrections, and the radiative cross section. XEMC also uses the Peaking approximation discussed in ~\cite{Article:RC2}. These radiative corrections now allow us to compare our Monte Carlo elastic data to our experimental data by means of Equation ~\ref{eq:rc}. Where $\sigma^{Exp}_{Rad}$ is the experimental cross section, $\sigma^{Exp}_{Born}$ is the experimental Born cross section, $\sigma^{Model}_{Rad}$ is the model radiative cross section, and $\sigma^{Model}_{Born}$ is the model Born cross section ~\cite{Thesis:Ye}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:rc}
	\sigma^{Exp}_{Born} = \sigma^{Exp}_{Rad} \frac{\sigma^{Model}_{Rad}}{\sigma^{Model}_{Born}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Aluminium Background Subtraction}
\label{ssec:al}

Many of the events detected by the experiment are derived from electrons scattering off of the Aluminium walls of the target cell. These are not events we want in our cross section measurement so steps are taken to subtract this background out of the sample. This is done by means of a `dummy' Al cell which is an empty Al cell. This dummy cell is placed in the beam and the electrons scattered from it are measured. Since the cell is empty the dummy shows how the Al background of the actual target cell will look. Finally after a few corrections the Al dummy cell data can be subtracted from the production data to give an Al background subtracted result which removes the Al contamination.

The Al background must be scaled to account for the different amount of beam charge that the dummy data collected as compared to the production data. For this analysis the dummy cell result must be multiplied by 21.2708 to match the charge of the experimental runs. The dummy cell also had different thickness walls Al thicknesses as compared to the target cell. To compensate for the larger dummy Al thickness the dummy data was scaled by another 0.1979 times.

Finally when subtracting the Al background found with the dummy cell from the $^3$He cell one must take into account the different radiative corrections due to the Al for the two cells due to the Al thickness differences. The Al dummy cell gives a radiative correction ratio of $\sigma^{Model}_{Born}/\sigma^{Model}_{Rad} = 1.823$ and the $^3$He target cell gives a ratio of $\sigma^{Model}_{Born}/\sigma^{Model}_{Rad} = 1.467$. Lastly, the Al dummy background is scaled by the ratio of the dummy radiative corrections, 1.823, to the target cell corrections, 1.467. The resultant scaled Al background is shown in red in Figure ~\ref{fig:al}. This red histogram is then subtracted from the blue histogram that represents the $^3$He production data that is still contaminated by Aluminium. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.1\linewidth]{Al_Background.png}

\caption[\bf{Scaled Aluminium Background}]{
{\bf{Scaled Aluminium Background.}} The red histogram shows the scaled Al background, and the blue histogram shows the $^3$He production data before the Al background is subtracted.}
\label{fig:al}
\end{figure}

Since the production data was taken on $^3$He we do not anticipate seeing events at $X_{Bj} > 3$ since that is the elastic peak. However, there are clearly events in this region above the elastic peak. These events must be coming from something other than the $^3$He gas. Notice that above the $^3$He elastic peak the scaled Al background closely matches the production background. This is strong evidence that these events are coming from scattering off of the Al of the cell. Once the Al background is subtracted out most of these events disappear leaving us with only the desired electrons that were scattered from the $^3$He target.
